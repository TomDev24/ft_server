4) so i looked througth on how to write Dockerfile
--https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/

--i have checked some examples on github, 
could not install mysql-server, so chaged it to mariadb,
and php 7.2 to 7.3

--So now i know how to use certain OS image, install packages to it, and copy files from build context to container
--after command i used commands
sudo docker build -t first . /// -t is for tag/name
sudo docker ps // -> result is empty ????
sudo docker images // shows all the images which i have on my device, including those which i pulled from Docker Hub

--So that means i have to run my new made image? Okay

sudo docker -t --name comon first // displays hello worlds as intend 
sudo docker ps // and container in there ?????

sudo docker ps -a // shows also stoped containers, and i can see mine
sudo docker rm [container_id] // removed the container from the list
sudo docker container rm [name]

-This time i did 
sudo docker run -t -d --name comon first // it stil exited, and doesnt show in list of active containers 
sudo doocker logs [container-name]
